		Toasts (unobtrusive mini-notifications) shown to user to alert them without bothering them (like in Android).
			You see a toast when manually uploading sync telling you if upload succeeded/failed.

		Better default cards (it uses the theta sign etc. instead of HTML stuff (tags/metachars), which looks weird to the user).
		New option: change flashcard's font size.

	Bug fixes

		Card images are preloaded (cached) so that viewing the images (when studying for example) is faster.

		Card manager list items are now more compact.
		Studying text auto resizes based on how big your screen is.
		When loading the card manager, the first few cards are quickly prettified (rounded corners removed & merged into one big list) so it looks prettier.
		Open Sans is now included so Cabra will always be in Open Sans (no fallbacks needed for Latin script.)
	Bugfixes
		**"No" and "sort of" studying results are flipped (so Cabra thinks you didn't know it if you click "sort of" and vice versa.) Thanks Kevin.
		Problems with &'s and HTML tags - they got infinitely escaped and started showing up weird when you sync.
		Importing flashcards with no question/answer could mess things up.
		Error gets thrown when you refresh page from elsewhere (on Project page -> refresh -> go home but there's an error). This blocked the move to jQM 1.3.0.

	Bugfixes

		Major bug: deleting card from card manager causes mayhem.
		Clicking edit project button in project tools page causes the edit dialog for ANOTHER project to come up - so if you click delete, a different project is deleted.
		You could edit a card in card manager and save it, with it having no question or answer.
		Project titles with &'s or other HTML entities get escaped so you see &amp; (that's bad.)
	Upgrades:
